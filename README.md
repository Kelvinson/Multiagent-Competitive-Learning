# Multiagent-Competitive-Learning
try to implement the training phase code for two agents in the competitive environment and  it's imcomplete.

I imported the competitive environment from OpenAI's [repo](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-competition) and revised the ppo algorithm from the [baseline](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo1) to adapt to the competitive environment.
